            Hi!<br />
            My name is Luka Jeremić.<br />
            I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree and will soon finish my Masters degree in Computer Science from RAF university. During my studies, 
			I developed a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and system design.
            <br />

			where I have been involved in  deploying web applications as well as developing, mantaining and upgrading the existing server infrastructure,
			further more I have been building and improving our teams web apps.

        </div>
        <div class="message user">

			  <br /><br />
			  Secondly, I am looking to expand my professional network and build meaningful connections within the tech community.
